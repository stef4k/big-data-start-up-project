# Big Data Startup Project
Joint group project of BDMA - UPC semester.  This project spanned four different courses and served as an introduction to startup work. The courses involved were Viability of Business Projects, Big Data Management, Semantic Data Management, and Debates on the Ethics of Big Data. The main goal was to identify business opportunities, apply big data technologies, and develop a data-intensive startup concept.

Our final idea is the app <b>Lets Talk</b> which aims to help users connect meaningfully by
generating dynamic, up-to-date questions based on shared interests. Designed for individuals
seeking to quickly discover common interests and spark engaging conversations, it is an app
that instantly compares the profiles of two users and generates fascinating questions. In the
final stage, we visualized that this connection is implemented using NFC or qr-codes to reduce
manual tasks and automate the process for the users. This new method will make it easier to
find common ground, making social interactions feel more fun.
